## 🚀 TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS

### **Data Visualization Approach**
- Used Python (matplotlib) instead of AI generation for accuracy
- Cyberpunk color scheme (#00FFFF, #FF00FF, #FF8800, #9D00FF)
- Dark background (#0F172A) for consistency
- High DPI (150) for crisp rendering
- Saved as PNG for web optimization

### **Content Organization**
- Research topics organized by category, not chronology
- Each substance profile follows consistent structure
- Memorial page uses different color scheme (magenta vs. cyan) to distinguish tone
- All pages use 3D glitch effects for visual continuity

### **Responsive Design**
- All pages adapt to mobile, tablet, desktop
- Grid layouts collapse to single column on small screens
- Font sizes use clamp() for fluid typography
- Images scale proportionally

### **Performance Optimization**
- Images compressed for web
- CSS uses hardware acceleration
- Minimal JavaScript for effects
- Lazy loading for off-screen content
